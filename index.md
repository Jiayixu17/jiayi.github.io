### Research Experience
**China University of Geosciences - Center for International Cooperation in E-Business**<br>         
**Mar 2021 - Present**<br> 
**Research Assistant**<br>
**Advisor: Prof. Zhen Zhu**<br>

- Project: Knowledge Graph Construction and Attribute Value Extraction for Large-scale Textual Data of Tourism Products      
  - Used Python to crawl and preprocess product textual data from Ctrip.com.
  - Constructed a domain ontology for tourism products, incorporating 9 feature dimensions.
  - Extracted tourism product features using BERT-BiLSTM-CRF and merged entities with highly semantic similarity.
  - Imported entities and relations into a Neo4j database for graph visualization.
  - Obtained product similarity through link prediction algorithms (Adamic-Adar) and modified cosine similarity.    

- Project: Research on Product Homogeneity Characteristics and Performance of Complementors in E-commerce Platforms       
  - Measured the homogeneity level of products between platform owner and complementors by constructing graph networks and calculating graph node similarity.
  - Introduced 42 additional feature variables for the complementors and trained the sales forecasting model using XGBoost.
  - Generated parameter interpretation by SHAP feature importance derived from the XGBoost model.
  - Devised the plan to use causal inference methods to facilitate the interpretation of treatment variables.
