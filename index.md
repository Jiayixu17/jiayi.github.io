### About Me

Welcome to my personal website!

I pursued my undergraduate studies in **Information Management and Information Systems** at the **China University of Geosciences(CUG)**. My early university years involved a multitude of projects centered around text mining, where I enjoyed the experience of extracting valuable information from unstructured data. As my undergraduate career progressed, I found myself captivated by causal inference—a field both intricate and fascinating. Distinct from mere correlation, the discernment of causality is undeniably complex. As someone who naturally explores the essence of matters in life, the process of seeking the fundamental nature of problems resonates strongly with me.

Based on interdisciplinary, I have grown to appreciate the strengths of diverse knowledge and enjoy applying them to solve real-world challenges. Additionally, I firmly uphold the philosophy that learning goes hand-in-hand with living, implying that valuable knowledge not only informs but also shapes my worldview. Two domains have profoundly influenced my approach to life: **machine learning has shown me the virtues of empiricism—suggesting that life is an ongoing experiment of self-discovery; while causal inference has instilled in me the importance of understanding my authentic self by looking beyond the surface.**

**No passion, no life!**
